# Summary

Data from Earth observation satellites, airborne science platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and in situ platforms can be used to address development challenges around the world. Our challenge is to use this data to enable local stakeholders to develop more sustainable, disaster-resilient and inclusive urban plans.

Details To make urban spaces more inclusive, resilient and sustainable, we need to leverage high-quality, timely and reliable disaggregated data to inform the creation and management of inclusive urban development plans. These plans must include improvements that allow access to basic services (water, electricity, etc.) and public transportation, allow access to open spaces for public use for all, and incorporate policies to improve marginal neighborhoods, among other elements.

# Introduction

Through the use of drones equipped with multispectral cameras that monitor a certain area and GPS to determine its precise location, which can be used in the event of a natural disaster or to patrol the municipality on a daily basis, observing, capturing images and transmitting the information to a center. computing, the state of the streets, lighting, power lines, losses of natural gas and drinking water.

# Objective

Develop a continuous and real-time monitoring system over an urban area in order to detect the state of public services to organize rescue groups in the event of a natural disaster or for preventive maintenance. This information provided by the Drones is related through software to the plans of the power lines, streets, public lighting and plans of the drinking water network to generate a map with the location of the damage.

# Project Description

Multispectral cameras allow the monitoring of small changes in visible and infrared radiation reflected by objects. It comprises a built-in stabilized imaging system that collects comprehensive data sets right out of the box. a multispectral camera array with 5 cameras covering the blue, green, red, red edge and near infrared bands.

Multispectral cameras work by obtaining images of different wavelengths of light. The multispectral camera has 5 imagers, each with a special optical filter that allows that imager to only capture a precise set of wavelengths of light. Once processed, the camera data output is a set of images where the value of each pixel is equal to the percentage of reflectance of light for that particular wavelength. These image sets are then stitched together to create geographically accurate mosaics, with multiple layers for each wavelength.

Synchronized capture of multispectral, thermal and high resolution imaging solutions. • Calibrated thermal and multispectral outputs. • High resolution multispectral images. • USB 3.0 storage. • Fast catch rate. • Integrates with any drone that can transport it.

# Detection of faulty power line and locate civilians in disaster areas

Using infrared thermography, we can locate civilians in disaster areas, being able to detect their state of health to go quickly and breakdowns in the electrical installation of the affected area. They can also be used for preventive maintenance of the installation of public lighting poles that can cause greater damage to the installation and / or accidents. Thermal imaging cameras can detect increases in temperature in objects, such as people or those caused by short circuits in the electrical installation. With this information it is possible to identify civilians at risk and / or possible breakdowns and take the necessary measures to avoid accidents or major damage.

Using photoelectric sensors, the Drone can perform night tours to detect the intensity of public lighting lamps, identifying those that are in poor condition.

# Approach to water leak detection

By performing a downward facing multispectral camera analysis, we can identify pools of water that may be due to leaks in drinking water pipes. This information can be useful to the departments responsible for maintaining the drinking water service.

In the graph you can see the difference in the wavelength reflectivity of drinking water and dirty water detectable with a multispectral camera, so a drone could indicate the location of possible losses in the drinking water network. This information could be very useful for the authorities.

By taking photos of the streets at different times, you can identify and track asphalt damage

Passive vision (camera) is used to detect different patterns on the road. For example, to identify whether the road surface is asphalt or cobblestone or an unpaved (dirt) road. This approach may be useful for departments or organizations responsible for road and road maintenance. Another relevant factor is related to the detection of potholes and puddles of water, which can generate accidents, damage vehicles. With the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the semantic segmentation of the road surface. This may also be relevant for a smart vehicle, be it an autonomous vehicle or an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). Depending on the type of pavement, it may be necessary to adapt the way the vehicle is driven, either for the safety of the users or the preservation of the vehicle or even for the comfort of the people within it.

# Approach for Gas Leak Detection

Gas leaks and emissions are challenges for various industries like petrochemical and oil and gas industries resulting in financial losses and possibly human injuries. Therefore, in recent years, significant efforts are dedicated to developing reliable gas leak detection techniques. Moreover, some studies are devoted to introducing techniques for detecting the origin of possible leaks for launching corrective measures. Gas leaks can be very dangerous to health and the environment. In confined spaces like buildings, even a small leak in pipelines can gradually build up to be an extremely lethal or even explosive amount of gas which can endanger staff. The release of some gases such as natural gas, propane, and isobutane into the atmosphere is harmful due to their effect on global warming or ozone depletion.

Using unmanned aerial vehicles for the inspections can decrease the risk as well as the cost and time of the operation. The maneuver capabilities provided by drones can assist inspectors with better access to the facilities and reduce the inspection time, which can motivate the companies to perform them more regularly. Moreover, this approach minimizes the number of required staff on-site, which can also lead to cost- and time-saving and an increase in operational safety. Therefore, introducing drone-enabled techniques for the detection and characterization of gas leaks is very essential and is the main motivation behind this study

# The sample of camera motion paths for the four scenarios

In the event of a natural disaster, the information from an aerial visual map (google earth) of the streets can be used as a reference and compared with the images collected by drones to identify fallen posts and objects that are out of place, that were not in the original map. With this information it is possible to evaluate the damages and assign the groups of tasks according to priorities
